## Step 1 â€“ testing
The goal is to test a specific buggy implementation of the matrix multiplication software. Your
objectives are:

 * To identify test cases able to spot the errors and
 * To automate the execution of tests through Google Test.

The implementation to be tested is a matrix multiplication function made available as a compiled
object code. The function has the following signature:

```(c++)
void multiplyMatrices(const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& A,
const std::vector<std::vector<int>>& B, std::vector<std::vector<int>>& C,
int rowsA, int colsA, int colsB);
```

Use the template available [here](https://github.com/SimoneReale/SE4HPC_project_part1) to create your own github repository. The project includes:

 * The matrix multiplication object code in the library `libmatrix_multiplication.a` under the lib folder.
 * The header defining the matrix multiplication signature under the include folder.
 * The file `test_matrix_multiplication.cpp` under folder test that contains a simple example of test case.
 * The makefile you can use for building the software.
 * The file `matrix_mult.cpp` under folder src that includes a correct implementation of the matrix multiplication you can use as a reference

Your task is extending the file `test_matrix_multiplication.cpp` with your test cases. Please insert proper comments in the code to explain why you have selected that specific test case and the behaviour you expect from it. Push the result of your work in your repo. If your local environment does not allow you to create a correct build, consider using the GitHub actions and their runners. This will be useful also for your next task.


## Github action for scanning runtime errors
Since the proposed tests expose the errors of the implementation, they fail. To have a passing action and prevent spam emails from github, we have wrapped the execution of tests in a script that always returns zero.
In this script we added functionality to filter the output of the tests to automatically report the errors of the implementation (they are always displayed as `Error <number>: ...`). This feature could be made more sophisticated with committing the result of the filter in the repository via an action.
